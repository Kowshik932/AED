# WEB-DESGIN FOR EWAL ESTATE WEBPAGE

# Description
The objective of this project is to connect home buyers to sellers and tenants to renters directly to facilitate services including home trading and residential leasing without the intervention of local real estate agency as mostly they add no value to the transactions but substantially cost for both parties.

This web application is a third-party real estate broker platform providing real-time real estate listings and services to promote transparent home trading and leasing transactions for home buyers, sellers, renters, and tenants.

On top of building features for the website using HTML
I created the entire Home, Buy A Home, Rent A Home, Contact & Login pages of the company website.
